# InTech Backend
This repository contains the backend component of the InTech application.  
__InTech__ is a search engine specifically designed for technology articles.  
The platform indexes articles from trusted sources and directs users to the original content with a single click.  
__InTech__ does not produce or host any articles; it serves solely as a gateway to high-quality technology journalism.
